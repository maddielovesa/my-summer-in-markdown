#  **All About Me**

Hello! My name is Madeline but I prefer when people call me Maddie. I am 15 years old and my birthday was in the summer so I enjoyed celebrating that with my family. I am excited to start my second year of AP Computer Science and be able to collaborate with my classmates. I play basketball and I enjoy playing it. One of my favorite hobbies is to cook or bake. I look foward to getting to know more about how to code!

I also was able to learn a few new skills in my sport which was an accomplishment for me since I am able to use it in games. 


#  **Summer with friends**

While on summer break, I got to hang out with my friends a lot. Usually, we just hung out at the mall or near stores which was super fun. I got to go swimming with my friends during the summer a lot and I even made new friends. Summer was a great time to hang out with all of my friends outside of school.
